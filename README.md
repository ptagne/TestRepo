# <b>Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction.</b>
<br>
The ability to reliably forecast first-stage landing success has profound implications for the economics of space access. While SpaceX has achieved remarkable landing success rates through engineering excellence, the complex interplay of factors affecting each landing outcome—including payload characteristics, launch parameters, and environmental conditions—creates an ideal scenario for predictive analytics. This project addresses the strategic need to quantify and predict landing success probabilities, enabling data-driven decision-making in mission planning and resource allocation.<br>
