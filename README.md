# <b>Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction.</b>
<br>
The ability to reliably forecast first-stage landing success has profound implications for the economics of space access. While SpaceX has achieved remarkable landing success rates through engineering excellence, the complex interplay of factors affecting each landing outcome—including payload characteristics, launch parameters, and environmental conditions—creates an ideal scenario for predictive analytics. This project addresses the strategic need to quantify and predict landing success probabilities, enabling data-driven decision-making in mission planning and resource allocation.<br>

<br><b>Conclusions:</b><br>

Point 1) Data Collection Excellence: Successfully aggregated data from SpaceX API, secondary endpoints, and Wikipedia scraping.<br>
Point 2) Modeling Success: Achieved exceptional prediction accuracy across multiple algorithms, Identified Decision Tree as the most effective predictor with more than 94% test accuracy, and leveraged GridSearchCV for systematic parameter tuning across all models.<br>
Point 3) Technical Implementation: We used our knowledge to perform the analysis<br>
Point 4) Immediate Practical Applications: Enable SpaceX to assess landing success probability before launch commitments, inform booster recovery strategy decisions, provide quantitative metrics for mission success likelihood, and support decisions on booster refurbishment vs. new construction.<br>
Point 5) Limitations and Future Work: <br>
Data Scope was limited to historical launches data; real-time operational factors not included. Feature Availability is dependent on publicly accessible parameters, and temporal Factors like Weather conditions and real-time anomalies not incorporated in our analysis.
Advanced Features such as Integrated real-time weather data, mechanical sensor readings, model sophistication like exploring ensemble methods, neural networks, time-series analysis, and operational integration such like developping API for real-time prediction during mission planning will be great.<br>
